Bibliography Space

A simple website to list books with properties. Please contribute if you can.

The Why
-------

All over the Internet there are various scrapes and shards of some kind of
global collection of books. If there is some that's sufficiently big enough,
it's either English mostly or it's paid to access, or has other quirk when
trying to do statistics over a dataset of books or use within an application
when you as a developer do not have the means or want to pay when developing
a hobby project.

After a while an idea of scraping bookstores comes into the mind which
-- officially -- is against the terms of their websites. No matter what step
you take, either the dataset is not complete enough in <insert your language>
or has *some* restriction for its usage or is fully bloated by unnecessary
JavaScript, advertisements and similar crap.

There is a better way though.

The How
-------

Creating a global database on such a scale is too cumbersome for a single
individual. But as free and open-source software has proven, it's very possible
to assemble a big collection out of tiny scrapes when multiple people join.

This, in combination with a version control system (such as ``git``) makes
an ordinarilly flat table-like collection a collection which can be contributed
to with a log of who and when added it as well as to just download as static
files to use as a dataset, base for an API, etc. Stuff an ordinary paid API,
bookstore websites or a paid database won't provide you.
